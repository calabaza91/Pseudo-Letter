      <h1>RE: Gretta Funke university application</h1>

      <p>Dear Gretta,</p>
      <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of
        Radville's science faculty to study as a part of your
        <abbr title='Doctor of Philosophy'>PhD</abbr> next year. I will answer
        your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>

<!--Secton 1: Starting Dates-->
      <h2>Starting dates</h2>
      <p>We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time,
        however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a
        semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>
  <!--unordered list of dates-->
      <ul>
        <li>First semester: <time datetime="2018-09-09">9 September 2018</time></li>
        <li>Second semester: <time datetime="2019-01-15">15 January 2019</time></li>
        <li>Third semester: <time datetime="2019-05-02">2 May 2019</time></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Please let me know this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
      <p>You can find more information about <a href="urad.com">important university dates</a>
      on our website.</p>

<!--Secton 2: Subjects of study-->
      <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
      <p>At the Radville Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research
        facility &mdash; as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of
        science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher,
        and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that,
        of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows,
        in order of priority:</p>
      <!--ordered list of subjects-->
      <ol>
        <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol
          (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
        <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funck bassplayers at temperatures
          exceeding 30&deg;C (86&deg;F), when the audience size exponentially
          increases (effect of 3 &times; 10<sup>3</sup> &gt; 3 &times; 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
        <li> <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and
           <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for
           representing musical scores.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects,
        including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff
        and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>

<!--Secton 3: Exotic dance moves-->
      <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
      <p>Yes you are right! As a part of my post-doctorate work, I <em>did</em>
      study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favourite dances
      are as follows, with definitions:</p>
      <!--description list-->
      <dl class="">
        <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
          <dd>A little known but <em>very</em> influential dance dating back as
          far as 300<abbr title="Before Christ">BC</abbr>, a whole village would
          dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock
          or be "fruitful".</dd>
        <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
          <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm,
          they used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close
          together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around
          in imperceptably tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students
          used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as
          Twerking.</dd>
        <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
          <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English
          explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style
          characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by
          inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was
          discovered that they were just moving like this because they were
          really cold.</dd>
