      <p>Dear Gretta,</p>
      <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of
        Radville's science faculty to study as a part of your

        your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>

<!--Secton 1: Starting Dates-->
      <h2>Starting dates</h2>

        semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>
  <!--unordered list of dates-->
      <ul>
        <li>First semester: <time datetime="2018-09-09">9 September 2018</time></li>

<!--Secton 3: Exotic dance moves-->
      <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
      <p>Yes you are right! As a part of my post-doctorate work, I <em>did</em>
      study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favourite dances
      are as follows, with definitions:</p>
      <!--description list-->
      <dl class="">
        <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
          <dd>A little known but <em>very</em> influential dance dating back as
          far as 300<abbr title="Before Christ">BC</abbr>, a whole village would
          dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock
          or be "fruitful".</dd>
        <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
          <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm,
          they used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close
          together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around
          in imperceptably tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students
          used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as
          Twerking.</dd>
        <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
          <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English
          explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style
          characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by
          inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was
          discovered that they were just moving like this because they were
          really cold.</dd>
